## How to work at home

During my first interhsip, which was my first experience working as a software developer (game developer, actually) it was fully remote. Then, I've spent next
5 years working on-site until 2015, when I switch to a fully remote. At 2016 I've prepared a talk for The Mindcamp about how to work remotely and to try not getting
